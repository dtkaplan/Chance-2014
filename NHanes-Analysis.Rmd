Examples from the NHANES data for the Chance article:

## Loading the Data

```{r}
load('nhanes.rda')
```

## Simpson's Paradox

Smoking seems to make no difference to the probability of having died, unless one adjusts for age.

```{r}
summary(glm( d==1 ~ smoke, data=nhanes, family="binomial"))
summary(glm( d==1 ~ smoke+sex+age, data=nhanes, family="binomial"))
```

Better to look at all-cause mortality: perhaps smoking raises your awareness or changes your risk of death from other causes.

```{r}
summary(glm( d!=0 ~ smoke, data=nhanes, family="binomial"))
```

Adjusting for age and sex produces a larger relationship *in the other direction*.


## Graphs

Make some graphs with inference to show how easy this is, e.g. height versus age for pre-adults.
